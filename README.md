A single-page application to view trending gifs and search for any gifs

In this SPA, users can explore all trending gifs or search for a specific subject of gifs. I made the app using pure JavaScript after seeing lots of React SPAs. It gives users a better experience when they don't need to wait for a new page to load. I'm currently familiarizing myself with React and will recreate this app using React after. In the meantime, take a look at [this app](https://giphyapi.angusyeh.com/)!
